# SpaceX Front-End Test

Create a Javascript app that provides a brief overview of SpaceX's _rockets_ and _dragons_. 🚀🛰

## Description

Build a React app with the functionality that meets the following requirements:

- Fetch and render a list of _rockets_ or _dragons_ from SpaceX's API.
- Show extended information about a selected list item in a separate box, modal or page.

## API 🗄

Please refer to [SpaceX's open API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/) for this task. The `/rockets` and `/dragons/` endpoints should provide the necessary data.

## Suggested UI 🌁

1. Buttons or tabs to switch the list subjects (rockets, dragons).
2. Grid representation of the list.
3. Single item view with extended description (image, name, etc.).
